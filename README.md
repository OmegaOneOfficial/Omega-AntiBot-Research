# 🛡️ Sentinel-Core by 0mega Code
**"Protocol 0mega-One: Activated"**

The ultimate hybrid detection system designed to identify and neutralize automated bot accounts. Unlike basic filters, **Sentinel-Core** analyzes both chat patterns and robotic movement behaviors across multiple programming environments.

## 🕵️ Mission Overview
The rise of flash-infiltration bots requires a more advanced approach. This project focuses on:
* **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying suspicious link-bypass techniques.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Detecting non-human movement (Static spamming, Anti-AFK, and Teleports).
* **Cross-Platform Defense:** Providing the same high-level security for any game engine.
